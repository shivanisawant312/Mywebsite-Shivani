       <h2>@container</h2> //container(it is an empty space) has no meaning we can use div 
       
       <h3>fluid container</h3>   //we use css to make it nice
       <div>this is a fluid container and it will go end of page</div> //div is used as placeholder
       
       <h3>center container</h3>   //we use css to make it nice
       <div>this is a center container and it will go to specified width of page</div>

       <h2>links</h2>
       <a href="https://google.com">Shivani</a>  //there is link under Shivani if i click it goes google page
       <a href="/">Primary link </a> //i just want design it does not go anywhere
       <a href="/">Secondary link </a>
       <hr>
       Here is another important concept inline as we see here PRIMARY LINK AND SECONDARY LINK both print on same line
       inline VS block element
       html and css is work on concept line break
       block - when you write something and it take entire row in itself is called block element
       block ele - h3,p,div
       inline - when you write something and it does not take entire row it only takes it own place 
       inline ele - small,a,abbr,
